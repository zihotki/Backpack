# Backpack
This project is a try to provide a common solution to implicitly pass various contextual 
information useful for servicing purposes (logging, tracing, calculating metrics) through the call chain. 

# Integration
The initial goal of the project is to have integration with Serilog logging library and EasyNetQ (RabbitMQ). 

# References
